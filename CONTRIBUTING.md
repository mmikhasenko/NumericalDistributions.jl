# Feature Implementation Strategy and Checklist

This document provides a general guideline and checklist for adding a new feature or making a significant update to this package. It is inspired by the structured approach used for recent feature additions.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Define & Plan
- Clearly describe the feature or update, including its purpose, expected inputs/outputs, and user-facing API.
- Ensure the API is consistent with Julia best practices and, where relevant, the Distributions.jl interface.
- Identify any new dependencies or external packages required.

### 2. Prototype & Design
- Develop a working prototype or reference implementation (in a script or notebook).
- Decide on the main types and interfaces (functions, structs, etc.).
- Plan for integration with existing package types and workflows.

### 3. Implementation Steps

#### 3.1. Prepare Dependencies
- Add any new dependencies to `Project.toml` and ensure compatibility.

#### 3.2. Implement Core Logic
- Create or update the relevant source file(s) in `src/`.
- Implement the main function(s) and types, following the packageâ€™s style and conventions.
- Add Julia docstrings and type annotations.
- Ensure the implementation is modular and testable.

#### 3.3. Integrate with Main Module
- Include the new/updated file(s) in the main module (e.g., via `include(...)` in `src/NumericalDistributions.jl`).
- Export new user-facing functions/types as appropriate.
- Ensure new features are discoverable and usable alongside existing package functionality.

#### 3.4. Testing
- Add comprehensive tests in `test/runtests.jl` or a dedicated test file:
  - Test basic functionality and edge cases.
  - Compare with analytical or reference results where possible.
  - Test integration with other package features.
  - Adjust tolerances and handle numerical issues as needed.

#### 3.5. Documentation
- Add or update docstrings for all new/changed functions and types.
- Update the README with usage examples and explanations.
- Optionally, update or add to the package documentation in `docs/` (notebooks in `docs/` demonstrate features and may be turned into doc pages later).

### 4. Review & Finalize
- Review code for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to package style.
- Ensure all tests pass and documentation is up to date.
- Optionally, solicit feedback or code review from collaborators.
